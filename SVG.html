				<h3>1. Scalabe vector graphics</h3>
                <h3>What is SVG?</h3>
                   <p> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
                    SVG is used to define graphics for the Web
                    SVG is a W3C recommendation</p>
                <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support
                     for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.

                    SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.
                     As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software.
                    
                    All major modern web browsers—including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge—have
                     SVG rendering support.</p>
                     <h3>SVG on the web</h3>
                <p>The use of SVG on the web was limited by the lack of support in older versions of Internet Explorer (IE).
                     Many web sites that serve SVG images, such as Wikipedia, also provide the images in a raster format, either
                      automatically by HTTP content negotiation or by allowing the user directly to choose the file.
                    Google announced on 31 August 2010 that it had started to index SVG content on the web, whether it is in standalone files or 
                    embedded in HTML, and that users would begin to see such content listed among their search results. It was announced on 8 
                    December 2010 that Google Image Search would also begin indexing SVG files. The site announced an option to restrict image
                     searches to SVG files on 11 February 2011. Web search engine can parse and navigate this format.</p>
                     <h3>Mobile support</h3>
                     <p>SVG Tiny (SVGT) 1.1 and 1.2 are mobile profiles for SVG. SVGT 1.2 includes some features not found in SVG 1.1, including non-scaling strokes,
                          which are supported by some SVG 1.1 implementations, such as Opera, Firefox and WebKit. As shared code bases between desktop and mobile
                           browsers increased, the use of SVG 1.1 over SVGT 1.2 also increased.

                        Support for SVG may be limited to SVGT on older or more limited smart phones or may be primarily limited by their respective operating system.
                         Adobe Flash Lite has optionally supported SVG Tiny since version 1.1. At the SVG Open 2005 conference, Sun demonstrated a mobile
                          implementation of SVG Tiny 1.1 for the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) platform.
                        
                        Mobiles that use Opera Mobile, as well as the iPhone's built in browser, also include SVG support. However, even though it used the WebKit
                         engine, the Android built-in browser did not support SVG prior to v3.0 (Honeycomb). Prior to v3.0, Firefox Mobile 4.0b2 (beta)
                          for Android was the first browser running under Android to support SVG by default.
                        
                        The level of SVG Tiny support available varies from mobile to mobile, depending on the SVG engine installed. Many newer mobile products
                         support additional features beyond SVG Tiny 1.1, like gradient and opacity; this is sometimes referred to as "SVGT 1.1+", though there
                          is no such standard.
                        
                        RIM's BlackBerry has built-in support for SVG Tiny 1.1 since version 5.0. Support continues for WebKit-based BlackBerry Torch browser
                         in OS 6 and 7.
                        
                        Nokia's S60 platform has built-in support for SVG. For example, icons are generally rendered using the platform's SVG engine. 
                        Nokia has also led the JSR 226: Scalable 2D Vector Graphics API expert group that defines Java ME API for SVG presentation and
                         manipulation. This API has been implemented in S60 Platform 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 and onward.Some Series 40 phones 
                         also support SVG (such as Nokia 6280).
                        
                        Most Sony Ericsson phones beginning with K700 (by release date) support SVG Tiny 1.1. Phones beginning with K750 also support 
                        such features as opacity and gradients. Phones with Sony Ericsson Java Platform-8 have support for JSR 226.
                        
                        Windows Phone has supported SVG since version 7.5.
                        
                        SVG is also supported on various mobile devices from Motorola, Samsung, LG, and Siemens mobile/BenQ-Siemens. eSVG, an SVG rendering
                         library mainly written for embedded devices, is available on some mobile platforms.</p>
