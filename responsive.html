				<h3>1. Responsive webpage</h3>
                <h3>What is Responsive webpage?</h3>
                   <p> Responsive web page (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website,
                        depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. ... In responsive page, page elements
                         reshuffle as the viewport grows or shrinks.</p>

                <p>A responsive website is one that has been designed to respond, or adapt, based on the technology and type of computing device
                     used by the visitor to display the site. It is basically one website design that will looks good at any size â€” from a large desktop 
                     LCD monitor to the smaller screens we use on smartphones and tablets. Responsive design ensures visitors to the site have a similar 
                     experience that is independent of the of the size of the device device used to view the site.</p>

                     <h3>2. Responsive Website Design</h3>
                <p>Responsive website design (RWD) enables site designers to create once and publish the same content everywhere, for all devices.
                     It is a website development philosophy of rendering web pages in an efficient, optimized and easy-to-read format across a variety 
                     of devices and web browsers on different platforms.

                    Rather than the traditional approach of designing web pages for viewing on just desktop or laptop PCs, responsive design utilizes a variety
                     of newer web development features and functionality to deliver an optimal view to users on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets
                      as well as on traditional PCs and other electronic devices.
                    
                    Because of their smaller display size, mobile devices typically require a modified layout for content to help users navigate through the 
                    website more efficiently, and with responsive design, web developers are able to code their web pages with the flexibility to render
                     readable content at a variety of display sizes. This is due largely in part to websites that can continually and fluidly change, based 
                     on factors such as the viewport width.</p>
                    
                     <h3>Three Main Components of Responsive Design</h3>
                     <p>Responsive website design consists of the following three main components:

                        1] Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
                        2] Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to
                         specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
                        3] Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size 
                        of the viewport changes.</p>

                        <h3>How to Incorporate Responsive Design into Web Development</h3>
                        <p>A variety of responsive design techniques can be utilized to create responsive websites, but most frequently web developers 
                            will set major and minor width breakpoints based on viewport tag and CSS media queries, and then code to present optimized 
                            content layout and text based on the display size ranges between these breakpoints.

                            Another key to responsive web design is using relative values as much as possible as opposed to fixed attributes like width. 
                            This enables content to scale in size based on the device and platform the reader of the web page is using at the time.</p>
